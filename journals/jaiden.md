Today, I worked on:

1. With Cindy, Jordan, Nicholas, Elliot
    - We determined the different services we could have within our project 
    as well as what each service would have in its bounded context

2. With Cindy, Jordan, Nicholas
    - We created questions that could possibly be used in order to determine 
    the scent profile of a customer

3. With Cindy, Jordan
    - We worked on a starting docker-compose that could work with django, and 
    discussed if we wanted to move to only using fast APIs


Today, I found some useful plugins for tracking git changes and commits, 
thanks to Jordan. Git lens and Git graph are now a part of my arsenel
