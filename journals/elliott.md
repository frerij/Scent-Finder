We discussed the architecture of our project on this day, particularly about the microservices and which parts of the app would get their own microservices. The microservices we decided to include are:

- Accounts, Inventory, Customer, and Employee

We also briefly discussed employing both Django and FastAPI in this project, depending on the microservices. We mentioned using FastAPI in the Inventory microservice specifically, so that each one of us gets the chance to write one of the 5 major HTTP requests for the microservice.

Unfortunately, I developed a migraine some point shortly after this conversation, so I missed the rest of the day working on the Docker Compose file and the quiz questions!
