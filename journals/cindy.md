Today, we worked on:

- Splitting up our project into microservices (with Group)

We figured out our different microservices for our project - accounts, inventory, customer, employee.

- Figuring out questions for the quizzes (with Jaiden, Jordan, Nicholas)

We worked on figuring out some potential questions for our quizzes and which answers could go for which scents.

- Docker-compose.yml file (with Jaiden, Jordan)

We drafted up our initial Docker compose file, but we're still feeling unsure about whether we want to use Django, FastAPI, or a mix of both. Will need to consult with the full team again about our decision.

We wanted to start our Django project files but were unsure of how to do so.

Today, we worked on:

- Creating the Django Inventory project and REST files and Dockerizing it (with Group)

Elliott showed us how to start our Django inventory project using a local virtual environment before Dockerizing the project. There was an issue with Dockerizing, but Elliott and Jaiden were able to work it out with Curtis while Jordan, Nicholas, and I started adding features to the Issues Board.

- Adding backend features onto the GitLab Issues Board (with Jordan, Nicholas)

Jordan, Nicholas and I were able to add issues to create the backend components of our microservices. Each issue is to create the models, views, and paths of the different microservices. We hope to get most of the backend set up by the end of this week!
We also are planning to implement the Customer microservice using FastAPI and the Inventory microservice using Django.
