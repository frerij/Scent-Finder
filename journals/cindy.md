Today, we worked on:

- Splitting up our project into microservices (with Group)

We figured out our different microservices for our project - accounts, inventory, customer, employee.

- Figuring out questions for the quizzes (with Jaiden, Jordan, Nicholas)

We worked on figuring out some potential questions for our quizzes and which answers could go for which scents.

- Docker-compose.yml file (with Jaiden, Jordan)

We drafted up our initial Docker compose file, but we're still feeling unsure about whether we want to use Django, FastAPI, or a mix of both. Will need to consult with the full team again about our decision.

We wanted to start our Django project files but were unsure of how to do so.
